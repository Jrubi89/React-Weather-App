## React Weather App 
A social place to look up and chat about your local weather.

## About the App
----------
This app is built with **React** using the *Openweathermap API*. When the user opens the page they will be asked to enter in a specific *city* and *country* for weather they choose to search.
The API will find the user the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and a brief description with the corresponding icon for the current weather.
